Chapter 4: Script Execution and Shebang
This chapter explains how to execute Bash scripts correctly.

Shebang (#!): It is placed at the beginning of a script and specifies the path to the Bash executable. For example, #!/bin/bash indicates that the script should be run as a Bash script.

Marking scripts as executable: To execute a Bash script, it must have executable permissions. Use the chmod command to mark a script as executable. For example, chmod +x script.sh makes "script.sh" executable.
