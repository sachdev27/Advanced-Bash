Chapter 5: Quotes and Special Characters
Quotes and special characters have specific meanings in Bash scripting.

Single quotes ('): They preserve the literal value of each character. Variables and special characters are not expanded within single quotes.

Double quotes ("): They allow variable expansion and interpretation of certain special characters. For example, echo "Hello $USER" expands the USER variable.

Escaping special characters: Special characters can be escaped using a backslash (\). For example, echo "This is a \"quote\"" will print: "This is a "quote"".
