# Chapter 3: String Manipulation
This chapter explores string manipulation techniques in Bash scripting.

AWK: AWK is a powerful text processing tool. It can extract and manipulate strings using patterns and actions. For example, awk '{ print $1 }' file.txt prints the first column of text from "file.txt".

Sed: Sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text. It's useful for substituting, deleting, and manipulating strings. For example, sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt replaces all occurrences of "old" with "new" in "file.txt".
