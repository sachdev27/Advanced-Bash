Chapter 6: Variables
Variables are used to store values and manipulate data in Bash scripting.

Variable assignment: Assign values to variables using the = operator. For example, name="John" assigns the value "John" to the variable name.

Predefined variables: Bash provides several predefined variables, such as $0 (script name), $1, $2, etc. (command-line arguments). For example, $0 represents the name of the currently running script.

Environment variables: Environment variables store system information. Use the env command to display all environment variables.
