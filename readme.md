# Bash Scripting 
This repo aims to provide a comprehensive guide to Bash scripting, covering various aspects and techniques. The tutorial is divided into the following chapters:

## Chapter 1: Expansions
This chapter introduces Bash script expansions, which are handy shortcuts. It covers tilde expansion, which represents the user's home directory and the previous directory visited. It also discusses brace expansion, which allows for repeated commands with different terms or interpolation within a range.

## Chapter 2: File Creation and Manipulation
In this chapter, you will learn how to create and manipulate files using Bash scripting. It demonstrates how to create multiple files using brace expansion and showcases the ability to pad numbers with zeros. It also highlights the importance of considering platform compatibility when using certain features.

## Chapter 3: String Manipulation
String manipulation is a common task in Bash scripting. This chapter explores powerful tools such as AWK and sed for string manipulation within Bash scripts. It encourages you to explore these tools further by referencing their respective documentation.

## Chapter 4: Script Execution and Shebang
Executing Bash scripts correctly is crucial. This chapter explains the use of shebang (#!) followed by the path to the Bash executable to specify that a script should be run as a Bash script. It also emphasizes the significance of marking scripts as executable.

## Chapter 5: Quotes and Special Characters
Quotes and special characters play a vital role in Bash scripting. This chapter covers the use of single quotes and double quotes. It explains how special characters can be escaped with a backslash () and showcases the differences between them in terms of variable interpretation.

## Chapter 6: Variables
Variables are an essential component of Bash scripting. This chapter introduces variables and their usage within scripts. It explores various predefined variables, such as "$0" (script name) and "$1", "$2", etc. (command-line arguments). It also addresses considerations when working with numbers, including limitations with floating-point numbers and the use of the "bc" command for precision calculations.

## Chapter 7: Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of a Bash script. This chapter explains if-statements and demonstrates their usage for executing code based on the truth value of an expression. It also covers logical operators and provides examples of using the test command with both single square brackets and double brackets.

## Chapter 8: Text Replacement and Formatting
Text replacement and formatting are common tasks in Bash scripting. This chapter introduces the "sed" command for string replacement and demonstrates its usage. It also explains escape codes for formatting text, including colors and styles, using the "tput" command.

## Chapter 9: Functions
Functions allow for modular and reusable code in Bash scripting. This chapter explores defining and calling functions, showcasing examples of basic functions and their usage within a script. It highlights the flexibility of function contents and their usefulness in encapsulating code.

## Chapter 10: Loops
Loops enable repetitive execution of code blocks. This chapter covers different types of loops in Bash scripting. It explains while-loops and for-loops, providing examples of their implementation. It also demonstrates how associative arrays can be used within loops.

## Chapter 11: User Input and Flags
Interacting with users and handling input is essential for interactive Bash scripts. This chapter explains how to obtain user input at the command line and discusses the usage of flags or options. It showcases the use of case statements for handling different input scenarios.

## Chapter 12: Error Handling
Error handling is crucial for robust and user-friendly scripts. This chapter covers strategies for error handling, including checking the number of arguments, validating input, and providing informative error messages. It emphasizes the importance of handling unexpected situations gracefully.
